## Lab 1 – 2-Input Logic Gates Implementation (lab1)

**Description:**  
Implement basic **2-input logic gates** on FPGA using VHDL.  
The device has **two inputs** (from switches) and **seven outputs** (to LEDs), each output representing a different logical operation (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, NOT, etc.).
