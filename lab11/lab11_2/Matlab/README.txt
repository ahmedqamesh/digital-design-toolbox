1. Run Matlab script up to line 41 will generate the “data2fpga.dat” which contains noisy signal
2. Then OPEN vivado project.
3. Change the hardcoded path to appropriate location (The same location where simulation_validation movingaverage.m locates).
4. Run behavioral simulation
5. After the simulation finished, the datafromfpga.dat should be generated.
6. run the rest of the matlab script.
